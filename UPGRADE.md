## General Upgrade Notes

This project uses a vendor boilerplate (SaaS Pegasus) as a foundation. Local customizations are tracked for all templates and files that are likely to conflict with vendor updates.

**Upgrade process:**  
- Review vendor release notes for breaking changes and new features.
- Compare local files against vendor updates, focusing on files listed in "Template Overrides & Customizations".
- Summarize differences and resolutions in this file.
- Resolve conflicts by retaining local business logic and UI improvements, while integrating necessary vendor changes.
- Test all affected features after merging.
