    "## 1. **Minimize Direct Edits to Boilerplate Files**\n",

    "- Instead, use Django’s [template inheritance](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/templates/#template-inheritance) and [template overrides](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/templates/#overriding-built-in-templates).\n",

    "## 2. **Customizations: Use Your Own App Layer**\n",
    "- Place your custom templates, static files, and logic in your own Django app(s).\n",

    "- Example:  \n",
    "  - Instead of editing `components/team_nav.html`, create `myapp/templates/components/team_nav.html` and override or extend the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. **Track Local Changes**\n",
    "- Keep a clear record (in code comments or documentation) of what you’ve changed and why.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. **Automate Merges Where Possible**\n",
    "- Use tools like [git rerere](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rerere) to help Git remember how you resolved conflicts in the past.\n",
    "- This can reduce repeated manual conflict resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. **Upgrade Workflow Suggestion**\n",
    "1. **Keep a clean separation:**  \n",
    "   - Only upgrade the boilerplate in a dedicated branch (like `upgrade-pegasus`).\n",
    "2. **Rebase or merge carefully:**  \n",
    "   - After upgrading, re-apply your customizations as needed, ideally in your own app’s files.\n",
    "3. **Test thoroughly:**  \n",
    "   - After each upgrade, run tests and manual checks to catch issues early.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. **If You Must Edit Boilerplate Files**\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Potential for Drift:**  \n",
    "  If the vendor changes the context or expected variables in their components, your custom files may need updates to stay compatible.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Documentation Needed:**  \n",
    "  You should document in UPGRADE.md (or code comments) which files are custom and which are vendor, to help future maintainers.\n",

    "### 1. **Custom Include/Override Files (Your New Approach)**\n",
    "- **How:** Place customizations in separate files (e.g., `top_nav_schantt.html`) and include them in your templates.\n",
    "- **Pros:**  \n",
    "  - Minimizes merge conflicts.\n",
    "  - Clear separation of vendor and custom code.\n",
    "  - Easy to revert to vendor defaults.\n",
    "- **Cons:**  \n",
    "  - Slightly more files to manage.\n",
    "- **Robustness:** ★★★★☆\n",
    "- **Simplicity:** ★★★★☆\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Django Template Inheritance (Block Overriding)**\n",
    "- **How:** Extend vendor templates and override only the blocks you need to change.\n",
    "- **Example:**  \n",
    "  ```django\n",
    "  {% extends \"vendor/base.html\" %}\n",
    "  {% block top_nav %}\n",
    "    {% include \"web/components/top_nav_schantt.html\" %}\n",
    "  {% endblock %}\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **Pros:**  \n",
    "  - Only override what you need.\n",
    "  - Vendor updates to non-overridden blocks are inherited automatically.\n",
    "- **Cons:**  \n",
    "  - If vendor changes block structure/names, you may need to adjust.\n",
    "  - Can become complex if you override many blocks.\n",
    "- **Robustness:** ★★★★☆\n",
    "- **Simplicity:** ★★★★☆\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Monkey Patching or Template Loaders**\n",
    "- **How:** Use Django’s [template loader](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/templates/api/#loader-types) to prioritize your app’s templates over vendor’s.\n",
    "- **Pros:**  \n",
    "  - No need to touch vendor files.\n",
    "  - Django will always use your version if it exists.\n",
    "- **Cons:**  \n",
    "  - Can be confusing if you forget which template is being loaded.\n",

    "- **Simplicity:** ★★★☆☆\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Fork and Maintain Your Own Vendor Copy**\n",
    "- **How:** Fork the vendor repo and maintain your own version.\n",
    "- **Pros:**  \n",
    "  - Full control.\n",
    "- **Cons:**  \n",
    "  - Difficult to merge upstream changes.\n",
    "  - High maintenance burden.\n",
    "- **Robustness:** ★★☆☆☆\n",
    "- **Simplicity:** ★☆☆☆☆\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Patch Files or Automated Merge Tools**\n",
    "- **How:** Use patch files or tools like [git rerere](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rerere) to automate conflict resolution.\n",
    "- **Pros:**  \n",
    "  - Can automate repetitive merges.\n",
    "- **Cons:**  \n",
    "  - Adds complexity.\n",
    "  - Still requires manual review for major changes.\n",

    "## **Recommendation**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practice:**  \n",
    "- **Combine template inheritance/block overriding with custom include files.**  \n",
    "  - Use inheritance to override only what you need.\n",
    "  - Use custom includes for large or complex customizations.\n",
    "  - Document all overrides in your UPGRADE.md.\n",
    "\n",
