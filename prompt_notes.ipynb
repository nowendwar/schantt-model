    "## 1. **Minimize Direct Edits to Boilerplate Files**\n",

    "- Instead, use Django’s [template inheritance](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/templates/#template-inheritance) and [template overrides](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/templates/#overriding-built-in-templates).\n",

    "## 2. **Customizations: Use Your Own App Layer**\n",
    "- Place your custom templates, static files, and logic in your own Django app(s).\n",

    "- Example:  \n",
    "  - Instead of editing `components/team_nav.html`, create `myapp/templates/components/team_nav.html` and override or extend the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. **Track Local Changes**\n",
    "- Keep a clear record (in code comments or documentation) of what you’ve changed and why.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. **Automate Merges Where Possible**\n",
    "- Use tools like [git rerere](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rerere) to help Git remember how you resolved conflicts in the past.\n",
    "- This can reduce repeated manual conflict resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. **Upgrade Workflow Suggestion**\n",
    "1. **Keep a clean separation:**  \n",
    "   - Only upgrade the boilerplate in a dedicated branch (like `upgrade-pegasus`).\n",
    "2. **Rebase or merge carefully:**  \n",
    "   - After upgrading, re-apply your customizations as needed, ideally in your own app’s files.\n",
    "3. **Test thoroughly:**  \n",
    "   - After each upgrade, run tests and manual checks to catch issues early.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. **If You Must Edit Boilerplate Files**\n",
